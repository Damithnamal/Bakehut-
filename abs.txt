give me database creation and data insert ddl for sql


Creating and Inserting Data into a SQL Database can be a bit complex, especially when dealing with relationships between multiple tables. However, I will provide you with the SQL commands that can help you achieve this.

Please note that these commands are a basic structure and you might need to modify them based on your specific requirements.
